ABSTRACT = {Designing an electrical motor is a complex process that needs to deal with the non-linearity phenomena caused by the saturation of the iron at high magnetic field strength, the multi-physical nature of the investigated system and with requirements that may come into conflict. This paper proposes to use geometric parametric models to evaluate the multi-physical performances of electrical machines and build a machine learning model that is able to predict multi-physical characteristics of electrical machines from input geometrical parameters. The focus of this work is to accurately estimate the electromagnetic characteristics, motor losses and stator natural frequencies, using the developed machine learning model, at the early-design stage of the electrical motor, when the information about the housing is not available and to include the model in optimisation loops, to speed-up the computational time. Three individual machine learning models are built for each physics analysed, a model for the torque and back electromotive force harmonic orders, one model for motor losses and another one for natural frequencies of the mode-shapes. The necessary data is obtained by varying the geometrical parameters of 2D electromagnetic and 3D structural motor parametric models. The accuracy of different machine learning regression algorithms are compared to obtain the best model for each physics involved. Ultimately, the developed multi-attribute model is integrated in an optimisation routine, to compare the computational time with the classical finite element analysis (FEA) optimisation approach.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has drawn increasing attention owing to its potential use in large-scale industrial applications. Existing FL works mainly focus on model homogeneous settings. However, practical FL typically faces the heterogeneity of data distributions, model architectures, network environments, and hardware devices among participant clients. Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) is much more challenging, and corresponding solutions are diverse and complex. Therefore, a systematic survey on this topic about the research challenges and state-of-the-art is essential. In this survey, we firstly summarize the various research challenges in HFL from five aspects: statistical heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, communication heterogeneity, device heterogeneity, and additional challenges. In addition, recent advances in HFL are reviewed and a new taxonomy of existing HFL methods is proposed with an in-depth analysis of their pros and cons. We classify existing methods from three different levels according to the HFL procedure: data-level, model-level, and server-level. Finally, several critical and promising future research directions in HFL are discussed, which may facilitate further developments in this field. A periodically updated collection on HFL is available at https://github.com/marswhu/HFL_Survey.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a kind of distributed machine learning framework, where the global model is generated on the centralized aggregation server based on the parameters of local models, addressing concerns about privacy leakage caused by the collection of local training data. With the growing computational and communication capacities of edge and IoT devices, applying FL on heterogeneous devices to train machine learning models is becoming a prevailing trend. Nonetheless, the synchronous aggregation strategy in the classic FL paradigm, particularly on heterogeneous devices, encounters limitations in resource utilization due to the need to wait for slow devices before aggregation in each training round. Furthermore, the uneven distribution of data across devices (i.e. data heterogeneity) in real-world scenarios adversely impacts the accuracy of the global model. Consequently, many asynchronous FL (AFL) approaches have been introduced across various application contexts to enhance efficiency, performance, privacy, and security. This survey comprehensively analyzes and summarizes existing AFL variations using a novel classification scheme, including device heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, privacy, and security on heterogeneous devices, as well as applications on heterogeneous devices. Finally, this survey reveals rising challenges and presents potentially promising research directions in this under-investigated domain.}
